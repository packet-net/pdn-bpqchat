# pdn-bpqchat — design

**Status:** W0 (Go scaffold + RHPv2 client + do-nothing daemon) **done**; W1
(vendor BPQ source + this spec) **done**; W2 (the pure `internal/chat` domain +
SQLite store) **done — see §11**. The open design questions are resolved (§9).
Next is W3 (the RF user session: the BPQ-compatible `/command` parser wired to
the hub).

**Read order:** `HANDOVER.md` → this file → the vendored ground truth under
`reference/linbpq-chat/` (provenance in its `PROVENANCE.md`).

Everything in §3 (the BPQ wire protocols) is **derived from the LinBPQ source**,
not assumed; each claim cites the file/function it came from so the analysis is
reproducible. pdn-bpqchat is **clean-room Go** — it implements *to* this wire,
it does not port the C.

---

## 1. What we are building (recap)

A BPQ-Chat-compatible chat node, shipped as a **default-off pdn app package**,
with four pillars (HANDOVER.md §4): an **RF chat node** (local users over AX.25
through pdn), a **full web chat** (`/apps/bpqchat/`), **peering** with BPQ and
other pdn-bpqchat nodes, and **oracle-first BPQ interop**. RF users and web
users share the same topics.

## 2. Architecture (how it fits pdn — non-negotiable)

Strictly layered, **app-package-only**: the daemon reaches the node **solely
over RHPv2** (`internal/rhp`), never in-process. Mirrors pdn-bbs/pdn-convers
discipline; the language is Go (single static binary — HANDOVER.md language
decision).

```
cmd/pdn-bpqchat            the supervised daemon (wires the layers, owns lifecycle)
internal/config            supervisor env + chat.yaml → resolved Config; derives the callsign
internal/rhp               the RHPv2 client  (W0 ✅ — framing, codec, client, tests)
internal/chat   (W2)       the chat domain: topics, users, presence, message log, SQLite. Pure, host-free.
internal/session (W3)      RF user sessions: BPQ-compatible /command parser (hostile-input-safe), line assembler
internal/web    (W4)       the browser chat UI: SSE stream, channels, presence, history, send; app-gateway identity
internal/peer   (W5/W6)    PeerLink: the BPQ link protocol; loop/dup suppression; link lifecycle; multi-peer
```

**Layering rule:** `internal/chat` is the pure core (no RHP, no HTTP, no
sockets) — the same hub both `session` (RF) and `web` feed into, and that
`peer` propagates to/from. This is the seam that lets RF + web + mesh share one
room and lets the core be unit-tested without a node.

**Callsign:** derived as `<PDN_NODE_CALLSIGN>-<ssid>` (default SSID 4), never
hard-coded (`internal/config`). The supervisor provides `PDN_NODE_CALLSIGN` /
`PDN_RHP_HOST` / `PDN_RHP_PORT` / `PDN_APP_STATE`.

**RHP usage (the two paths the chat node needs):**
- **Inbound RF users / inbound peer links** — `socket`→`bind`(chat callsign, all
  ports)→`listen`; inbound connections arrive as `accept` pushes. One bound
  callsign serves *both* human users and linking nodes; they are told apart by
  their first line (§3.2).
- **Outbound peer dials** — `open`(Active) from the chat callsign to a peer,
  dialling **through the packet network** (§5). pdn replies after the connect
  resolves (deviation D4), so a successful `openReply` means the session is up.

## 3. The BPQ chat wire protocols (derived from `reference/linbpq-chat/`)

BPQ runs **two protocols over one connected-mode AX.25/NET-ROM session**: a
**user line protocol** (what a human types) and an **inter-node link record
protocol** (how two chat nodes sync). A connection is a *user* session by
default and is *promoted* to a *node link* when the first line is `*RTL`.

### 3.1 Framing

A chat session is a stream of **CR-terminated lines** (`\r`, 0x0D). There is
**no length prefix** — a line ends at the first CR; partial lines are
reassembled across packets (`HanksRT.c:ChatDoReceivedData`). This is a
deficiency (see §4.4): line length is unbounded and framing trusts the peer.

A line is an **inter-node control record** iff its **first byte is `FORMAT`
(0x01, Ctrl-A)** (`HanksRT.c:chkctl` — `if (Buffer[FORMAT_O] != FORMAT) return`).
Otherwise it is **user text / a user command**.

### 3.2 Link establishment handshake

Source: `HanksRT.c:ChatConnected`, `ProcessChatConnectScript`, `rtloginl`,
`bpqchat.h`.

On any new connection the node sends a **greeting banner**:

```
[BPQCHATSERVER-<flags>]
```

where `<flags>` are FBB-style capability characters (captured into
`conn->FBBReplyChars`). Then:

- **A human user** just starts typing — the node runs `rtloginu`, sends the
  `ChatWelcomeMsg`, drops them into the default topic, and shows a prompt.
- **A linking node** sends **`*RTL\r`** ("Round Table Link" login) as its first
  line. The receiver:
  1. checks the caller's callsign is in its configured peer list (`link_hd`,
     from `OtherChatNodes`) — **else refuses** ("does not have … defined as a
     node to link to");
  2. checks the caller isn't *already* a known node — **else refuses to prevent
     a loop** (`rtloginl`: "Refusing link … to prevent a loop");
  3. replies **`OK\r`**, marks the circuit `p_linked`, and runs **`state_tell`**
     (§3.4) to bring the new peer up to date, then sends an initial keepalive.

**Outbound** (we dial a peer) is the mirror: dial through the connect script
(§5), wait for `[BPQCHATSERVER-…]`, send `*RTL` + an initial keepalive, and on
the peer's `OK` run `state_tell` (`ProcessChatConnectScript`).

### 3.3 Inter-node link record protocol

Every control record (`HanksRT.c:chkctl`, builders `*_xmit`/`*_tell`/`put_text`,
constants `bpqchat.h:207-229`):

```
<FORMAT=0x01><TYPE><SP-separated fields…>\r
         byte 0     byte 1   bytes 2…N
```

`ncall` = the originating **node** callsign; `ucall` = the **user** callsign (or
a second node, for link/unlink). Fields are space-separated; the last field
(message text / name+qth) may contain spaces. On receive, bytes < 0x20 (except
BELL 0x07; TAB 0x09 → space) **reject the whole record as corrupt** — the only
input validation BPQ does.

| TYPE | const | meaning | fields after type byte |
|------|-------|---------|------------------------|
| `J` | id_join | user joined RT | `ncall ucall name qth` |
| `L` | id_leave | user left RT | `ncall ucall name qth` |
| `I` | id_user | user changed name/QTH | `ncall ucall name qth` |
| `D` | id_data | message to a whole topic | `ncall ucall text…` |
| `S` | id_send | private message to one user | `ncall ucall targetcall text…` |
| `T` | id_topic | user changed topic | `ncall ucall topicname` |
| `N` | id_link | node `ncall` gained a link to node `ucall` | `ncall ucall alias version` |
| `Q` | id_unlink | node `ncall` lost its link to node `ucall` | `ncall ucall …` |
| `K` | id_keepalive | node-node keepalive (doubles as a poll) | `ncall linkcall [version]` |
| `P` | id_poll | link-validation poll | `ncall linkcall` |
| `R` | id_pollresp | poll response (drives RTT) | `ncall linkcall` |

**Delivery semantics** (from `chkctl`): `id_data` is delivered to local users in
the originating user's **topic** (`text_tellu(..., o_topic)`) and appended to
the in-RAM history ring (`AddtoHistory`). `id_send` is delivered to one user if
they're local, else relayed onward. `id_join`/`id_leave` maintain the network
user table and announce presence. `id_user` updates name/QTH. `id_link`/
`id_unlink` maintain the **node graph** that loop suppression depends on.
`id_keepalive`/`id_poll` both elicit an `id_pollresp` and refresh
`lastMsgReceived`.

### 3.4 State sync on link-up (`state_tell`)

When a link comes up, each side **tells the other its entire known state**:
an `id_link` for the new link (relayed onward via `node_tell`), then the set of
known nodes, users (with name/QTH), and topic memberships it holds on *other*
links. This is a full dump — heavy, and a resync storm risk on a flapping link
(§4.5).

### 3.5 User line protocol (the `/` commands)

Source: `HanksRT.c:rt_cmd` + the built-in help text. Commands are
case-insensitive and start with `/`; **any line not starting with `/` is a
message to the user's current topic**.

| command | effect |
|---------|--------|
| `/U` | show users |
| `/N [name]` | set / show your name |
| `/Q [qth]` | set / show your QTH |
| `/T` | show topics |
| `/T <name>` | join / create a topic (names case-insensitive) |
| `/P` | show ports & links |
| `/K` | show known nodes |
| `/S <call> <text>` | private message to one user |
| `/A` | toggle join-alert (bell) |
| `/C` | toggle colour mode |
| `/E` | toggle echo |
| `/Time` `/ShowNames` `/Auto` `/UTF-8` `/Codepage CPnnnn` | display/encoding toggles |
| `/Keepalive` | toggle 10-min user keepalive |
| `/History <nn>` | show messages from the last `nn` minutes |
| `/F` | force all links up |
| `/B` | leave chat, return to node |
| `/QUIT` | leave chat and disconnect |
| `/H` `/?` | help |

pdn-bpqchat must accept this command set on the RF side for user familiarity
(W3); the web UI (W4) exposes the same actions as UI affordances over the same
core.

## 4. Deficiency analysis (HANDOVER.md §3 list — confirmed and extended)

### 4.1 No transport security / link auth — callsign-only trust
**Confirmed.** `rtloginl` authorises a link purely by matching the caller's
claimed callsign against the configured `OtherChatNodes` list. AX.25 has no
authentication, so any station that can present (or spoof) an allowed callsign
links. Cleartext throughout.
**pdn:** keep an **inbound allow-list as a first-class config concept** (a peer
must be listed to link in); posture is *cleartext-on-the-BPQ-wire for interop*
but **never accept an unlisted inbound link**. Leave room for a per-link shared
secret between two pdn-bpqchat nodes (negotiated via banner caps), without
breaking vanilla-BPQ interop.

### 4.2 User callsign spoofing across the mesh
**Confirmed.** `id_join`/`id_data`/`id_send` carry `ucall ncall` with zero
authentication; a hostile or buggy node can inject any user identity or message.
`user_find`/`user_join` trust them.
**pdn:** record **provenance** (which link a user/message arrived on); treat all
peer-supplied identities as hostile; rate-limit join/leave per link; surface the
origin node in the web UI so spoofing is at least visible. We cannot make the
BPQ wire authenticated, but we can contain blast radius (allow-listed links +
provenance + rate limits).

### 4.3 Loop / duplicate suppression is weak — the load-bearing problem
**Confirmed, and the worst of it.** BPQ uses **three** overlapping mechanisms:
- **Origin checks** (`chkctl`): drop a record from an unknown node, or from
  ourselves (`matchi(ncall, OurNode)`).
- **Spanning-tree relay** (`echo`): relay to every linked circuit *except* the
  ingress circuit and any circuit that already knows the origin node
  (`cn_find`). Correct only while the per-circuit known-node graph is
  consistent.
- **`CheckforDups`** for `id_data` only: a **10-entry, 5-second** window keyed
  on `(callsign, first 99 bytes of text)`. This is lossy (a 10th distinct
  in-flight message evicts; two messages sharing a 99-byte prefix collide;
  same-call different-text within 5 s can false-positive), **time-based not
  id-based**, and **does not cover** `id_send`/`id_topic`/`id_join`/`id_leave`.
- Plus **magic-number storm guards** (ignore a leave if connected < 3 s; don't
  re-report a join within 5 s) — an admission that the graph state is fragile.
**pdn — robust design in §5** (structural spanning-tree relay as the primary
mechanism + a content-hash dedup backstop, since the BPQ-format-only decision
(§9) leaves no wire id/hop field to use).

### 4.4 C string / buffer handling — hostile input assumed well-formed
**Confirmed.** Fixed buffers (`DupText[100]`, `callsign[10]`, `Msg[80/100/256]`),
`strcpy`/`strcat`/`sprintf` without bounds in places, `_strdup` of
attacker-controlled lines, and **`/S` does `strcat(Buffer, "\r")`** onto an
input buffer. Framing trusts an unbounded CR-terminated line; the only check is
the control-char corruption scan — **no length cap**.
**pdn:** a Go **line assembler with an explicit length cap** (drop / truncate
over-long lines), bounded fields, UTF-8-aware parsing, and a parser that treats
every byte from a peer or user as hostile. This is the single biggest
clean-room win.

### 4.5 Keepalive / link-timeout / resync on a flapping link
**Confirmed.** Keepalive doubles as a poll (`id_keepalive`/`id_poll` →
`id_pollresp`, RTT tracked); link liveness is `lastMsgReceived`; on link-up a
**full `state_tell` dump** runs (heavy; a reconnect loop can storm). Partial
messages are reassembled in `ChatDoReceivedData`. If there are **no local
users, all links are torn down** (`node_keepalive`→`node_close`).
**pdn:** explicit keepalive interval + timeout; **reconnect with exponential
backoff** (already the pattern in `cmd` and pdn-convers); **bounded, idempotent
resync** (reconcile state deltas, don't blindly re-dump); keep "drop idle links"
as a config option, not a hard default that surprises web users.

### 4.6 Character encoding & message length
**Confirmed.** Byte/ASCII-era with a UTF-8 *toggle* + codepage fallback and a
`ChatIsUTF8` heuristic; CR-terminated, no explicit length.
**pdn:** **UTF-8 native** internally and on the web; transcode at the BPQ wire
edge per the peer's caps; enforce a max message length.

### 4.7 No persistence / history / web (the headline improvements, not bugs)
**Confirmed.** History is an in-RAM ring (`AddtoHistory`, `/History nn`);
nothing survives a restart; terminal-only.
**pdn:** **SQLite history** + a **full web chat** — the value-add (HANDOVER.md
§4).

## 5. pdn-bpqchat's loop / duplicate suppression design

The acceptance gate is **"a cycle of nodes does not storm"** (HANDOVER.md §6d).
BPQ's heuristic (§4.3) is not good enough — but **we keep the wire byte-identical
to vanilla BPQ** (decision 2026-06-13, §9): **no extended framing, even between
two pdn nodes.** So there is **no wire-carried message id and no hop counter** to
lean on (BPQ's record format has neither, §3.3). That makes the **structural
mechanism load-bearing**, with a **content-hash dedup as the backstop**:

1. **Origin checks (keep BPQ's).** Drop a record from an unknown node, or one
   whose `ncall` is us (`matchi(ncall, OurNode)`) — the basic loop break.
2. **Spanning-tree relay — the primary mechanism.** Keep and *harden* BPQ's
   `echo` rule: relay to every linked circuit **except** the ingress circuit and
   any circuit that already knows the origin node (`cn_find`). This is purely
   **topology-based** — it needs no wire id — so it survives the BPQ-format-only
   constraint. Its correctness depends entirely on the **per-link known-node
   graph** being consistent, so that graph (built from `id_link`/`id_unlink` +
   `state_tell`) becomes a **first-class, unit-tested state machine**, not the
   fragile thing §4.3's 3 s/5 s magic numbers paper over. Re-link loop refusal
   (`rtloginl`: refuse a link from an already-known node) stays.
3. **Content-hash seen-set — the backstop.** A `seen` set keyed by a
   **deterministic synthetic id** computed identically on every node, purely from
   record content that is **stable across the mesh**:
   `synthID = hash(origin-ncall, ucall, type, normalise(text))`. A record whose
   `synthID` is already in `seen` is **dropped before delivery or relay**. This
   **strictly improves on `CheckforDups`**: it covers **all** record types (not
   just `id_data`), uses a full hash (not a 99-byte prefix), and a sized set with
   a TTL ≥ the longest plausible propagation delay (e.g. 10 min) rather than 10
   entries / 5 s. Because the id is content-derived, a record we *originated*
   that loops back to us via a cycle hashes to the same id and is dropped — the
   same property a wire id would give, without touching the wire.

**The residual limitation (stated honestly).** Without a wire id, two
*genuinely distinct* messages with identical `(origin, user, type, text)` inside
the TTL window collide and the second is suppressed — exactly BPQ's class of
false-positive, but far rarer here (full text hash, not a prefix; and identical
text from the same user in minutes is almost always a real duplicate anyway). A
true unique id is impossible on the BPQ wire by construction, so we make the
**structural** mechanism (2) carry correctness and treat (3) as the safety net
for the transient window while the node graph re-converges after a topology
change. If experience shows this is insufficient, the escape hatch is a future
capability-negotiated pdn↔pdn extension — explicitly deferred, not designed in.

**Acceptance test (W5).** Build `pdn ↔ BPQ ↔ pdn` and `pdn ↔ pdn ↔ pdn` cycles,
inject a message at one node, and assert (a) every node delivers it to its local
users **exactly once**, and (b) after the TTL no record is still circulating
(cf. packet.net INP3 "drain-once-per-round" / link-bench storm work). The test
must also **flap a link mid-cycle** to exercise the node-graph state machine (2),
since that — not a wire id — is what prevents the storm.

## 6. Identity, presence, topics across the mesh

- A network user is `(callsign, home-node)` (BPQ's `user_find(call, node)`),
  plus provenance (ingress link). Presence join/leave propagates as
  `id_join`/`id_leave`; name/QTH as `id_user`.
- Topic state reconciles on link-up via `state_tell` (§3.4) — pdn does this as a
  **bounded delta reconcile**, not a blind re-dump (§4.5).
- **Default topic:** **`General`** (decision 2026-06-13, §9) — every user (RF and
  web) lands in the topic named `General` on connect; topic names are
  case-insensitive (§3.5). This is **BPQ's own default**, verified in the source
  (`bpqchat.h:202` — `#define deftopic "General"`), so a pdn-bpqchat user and a
  BPQ-node user land in the **same shared room** with no reconciliation needed.

## 7. Persistence (SQLite, from W2)

State dir `/var/lib/packetnet/apps/bpqchat`, `bpqchat.db`. Tables (sketch):
`topics`, `users` (call, home-node, name, qth, current-topic, presence,
ingress-link), `messages` (msgid, origin-node, topic, ts, kind, text — the
web-visible **history** BPQ lacks), `links` (peer call, connect-script, state,
last-seen, RTT), `config`. The `seen` set is in-memory (TTL-bounded). The pure
`internal/chat` core owns the in-RAM model; the store is a persistence adapter
behind an interface so the core stays host-free and unit-tested.

## 8. Web chat (W4)

A complete browser UI at `/apps/bpqchat/`: live stream (SSE — already proven
shape; chunked/SSE pass-through is supported by the gateway), topic switching,
presence list, scrollback from SQLite, send box. **Identity** comes from the
app-gateway headers (`X-Pdn-User`/`X-Pdn-Scope`/`X-Pdn-Gateway`) — the app
trusts the gateway, never a separate login, and **binds loopback only** so the
headers are trustworthy (`internal/web` already enforces this). A web user is a
first-class user in the same topics as RF and mesh users.

## 9. Settled decisions & open questions

**Settled** (HANDOVER.md §8): default-off; BPQ interop required (peer wire
matches BPQ, internals clean-room); web chat first-class; peering is the
headline.

Confirmed here:
- **Peering rides the packet network, not a raw TCP socket.** The
  `OtherChatNodes` config is a `|`-separated **node connect script**
  (e.g. `RDGCHT:GB7RDG-1|C STHGTE|C 1 MB7NCR-2|C RDGCHT`) — a chain of node
  `C`(onnect) commands hopping AX.25/NET-ROM to the destination chat callsign.
  pdn dials this via RHP `open`(Active) through the node (HANDOVER.md §5
  vindicated — there is no "direct TCP chat-peering").
- **The bound callsign serves both users and node links;** `*RTL` as the first
  line promotes a session to a link.

**Resolved 2026-06-13 (Tom):**
- **Default topic = `General`.** Every user lands in the topic named `General`
  on connect (§6); topic names are case-insensitive.
- **Default peer transport = telnet node-link.** The dev loop links to the
  docker BPQ oracle over a telnet/IP node connection (the fastest loop, no RF
  sim); RF-via-RHP + net-sim is the realism pass in W6. The **live peer stays
  unset** until a parent chat node is arranged — develop against the oracle
  meanwhile (still blocked on that external prerequisite).
- **Multi-peer, staged.** v1 targets multiple simultaneous peers (peering is the
  point), staged: **W5** proves one peer + the loop-control backstop against the
  oracle; **W6** adds multi-peer + the RF link path. Robust loop suppression
  (§5) is built in from W5, not retrofitted.
- **BPQ-format only — no pdn↔pdn extended framing.** The inter-node wire stays
  byte-identical to vanilla BPQ on *every* link, including pdn↔pdn. Loop control
  therefore uses the structural spanning-tree relay (primary) + a content-hash
  dedup backstop, with **no wire message-id or hop field** (§5). A
  capability-negotiated extension remains a possible future escape hatch if the
  content-hash backstop proves insufficient in practice — explicitly **not**
  designed in now.

**Live test environment (Tom, 2026-06-13):** a **real BPQ node with a packet.net
lab adjacent to it, linked over AX.25**, exists for end-to-end testing. This is
the eventual **live RF-via-RHP peer** (W6) — the docker oracle covers the W5 dev
loop, then we link to the real BPQ node over AX.25 through the lab node. So the
"which real peer" item is effectively unblocked for the *interop* pass; only a
wider *public* parent chat node (to join the live network at large) remains a
later arrangement.

**Confirmed resolved:**
- The `General`-topic interop question (was open): **`General` is BPQ's own
  default** (`bpqchat.h:202`), so RF, web, and BPQ users share one room with no
  reconciliation — see §6.

## 11. What's delivered (this branch)

**W2 — the pure chat domain + persistence:**
- `internal/chat` — the **host-free core**: `Hub` (the in-RAM authority for
  users, presence, topics, and the mesh node graph), an `Event` stream
  (join/leave/message/private/topic-change/user-info/node-link, mapping 1:1 to
  the BPQ record types) fanned out to subscribers, the `Store` persistence seam
  with an in-memory implementation, the **`SeenSet`** content-hash de-dup
  backstop (§5), and **`SynthID`** (the deterministic cross-mesh message id).
  Length-capped, case-insensitive topics, callsign canonicalisation —
  unit-tested (join→General, post fan-out + history, topic moves, private
  messaging, link-drop user cascade, dedup, loopback suppression).
- `internal/store/sqlite` — the durable `chat.Store` over **pure-Go
  `modernc.org/sqlite`** (keeps the release binary CGO-free/static): the message
  log (idempotent saves, oldest-first history, case-insensitive topic, since/
  limit) + a config KV. Cross-compiles for amd64/arm64/arm with `CGO_ENABLED=0`;
  unit-tested.

**W0 — scaffold + RHP client + do-nothing daemon:**
- `internal/rhp` — a working, tested Go **RHPv2 client**: 2-byte framing, the
  message catalogue, Latin-1 data encoding, request/reply correlation by `id`,
  async push dispatch (`accept`/`recv`/`status`/`close`), and the
  socket/bind/listen/open/send/close + auth/hello surface. Unit-tested against
  an in-process fake server (listener path, port string/int, errCode casing,
  Latin-1 round trip, server-error propagation).
- `cmd/pdn-bpqchat` — the do-nothing supervised daemon: derive the callsign,
  bind+listen over RHP (reconnect with backoff), greet+close inbound, serve the
  loopback web tile.
- `internal/web` — the W0 placeholder tile proving the app-gateway identity
  contract; loopback-bound.
- `internal/config` — supervisor-env → resolved config; derived callsign.
- `reference/linbpq-chat/` — the vendored BPQ chat source (pinned, provenance
  recorded) this spec is derived from.

**Next: W3 — the RF user session.** Accept inbound RF connects over RHP (the
`accept` push), assemble CR-terminated lines (length-capped, hostile-input-safe,
§4.4), parse the BPQ-compatible `/command` set (§3.5), and drive the `Hub` —
subscribing each session to the event stream so RF users see each other (and,
from W4, web users) in real time.
